Some features that should work:

- Shows Manafication at correct breakpoints
- Shows combo actions during combo, including suggested finisher

#### SAM
- Shows next optimal combo, adjusts for manual/incorrect inputs
- Shows Iaijutsu in efficient place within combo sequence
- Shows when to spend or save Kenki

#### WAR

Stuff to be done:
- More consistent bitmasks for miss/combo stuff
