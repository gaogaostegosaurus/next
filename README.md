Some features that should work:

#### BRD
- nothing, because Shadowbringers was released

#### RDM
- Checks all possible spell combinations and uses a weight system to pick the best cast
- Shows/hides Manafication at correct breakpoints

#### SAM
- Works to 70ish
- Shows next optimal combo, adjusts for manual/incorrect inputs
- Shows Iaijutsu in efficient place within combo sequence
- Shows when to spend or save Kenki

#### WAR
- Shows next optimal combo to maintain Storm's Eye depending on upcoming cooldowns
- Makes decisions about when to use Inner Beast/etc
- Adjusts displayed icons on manual/incorrect inputs

#### Todo list... eventually?
- The other jobs ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
- More consistent bitmasks for miss/combo stuff? Kind of winging it right now
- Adjust weights for RDM to be better on edge cases
- Raid buff windows
