# nextActionOverlay

## What does it doooooo (generally)

- Snapshots your current character and suggests the next 15 seconds or so of actions
- Re-snapshots your character after every major action and modifies the action list
- Switches to AoE mode if it detects multiple targets, switches back on certain actions that imply single targets
- Ideally, it should suggest perfect or close-to-perfect dummy rotations

## Setup

- ACT FFXIV Plugin (obviously)
- ngld OverlayPlugin and Cactbot should also both be installed
- Add the overlay using the Custom preset, Miniparse type (actually not sure how much this matters)
- Overlay URL should be `https://gaogaostegosaurus.github.io/nextActionOverlay/overlay.html`.
