(but I am bad at networking and keep breaking my own website so who knows if it's up)

Some features that should work:

#### BRD
- Shows optimal next action

#### RDM
- Shows suggested next hardcast/dualcast actions
- Shows Manafication at correct breakpoints
- Shows combo actions during combo, including suggested finisher

#### SAM
- Shows next optimal combo, adjusts for manual/incorrect inputs
- Shows Iaijutsu in efficient place within combo sequence
- Shows when to spend or save Kenki

#### WAR
- Shows next optimal combo, adjusts for manual/incorrect inputs
- Shows spender notice when about to overcap
- Shows mitigation notice when no mitigation up but one is available


Stuff to be done:
- More consistent bitmasks for miss/combo stuff
